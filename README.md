# Augmented Reality Homework 1

 Augmented Reality Application created via Unity 2020.3.21f1 and Vuforia 10.2.5.
 This AR app displays a playground for kids on the image target I added. It has the following features:
-  Several stationary virtual object: Grasses, railings and all the other design stuff.
-  Animated virtual object: A kid who waves and jumps.
-  Moving object: Rotating swing.
-  Textual virtual object: A sign that says "Welcome to Playground Have Fun!".
-  Virtual object mapping a single picture: Playground Rules image on a stand object.
-  Virtual object mapping and playing a video: Scooby Doo clip on a stand object.
-  Three-step scenario where the user is interacting with the virtual objects: There is a UI button to switch between 3 different scenes. Also there's another UI button that changes the tree's scale step by step as you press the button (3 steps as well).
-  User selection of a virtual object: When you press the virtual button a soccer ball starts to rotate.
-  User selection of a button to change scenarios: There is a UI button that increases and decreases the intensity of a light inside the street lamp.
